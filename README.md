# modeling
I did the environmental modelling project during my class, trying to accurately represent how the prey populuation changes in reponse to one another.
Please take a look at the rendered pdf file, this does not have proper documentation, but the commneting should have made it easier to understand.

The project involves sobol sampling approaching and then quantifying change.
